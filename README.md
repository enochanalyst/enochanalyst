## Enoch's Portfolio
## Hi, Iâ€™m Enoch Babayanju
   A Data Analyst and Data Visualization Specialist with a background in History and International Studies. What excites me most about data is its potential to tell stories that help people make better decisions. I specialize in turning complex data into something clear, interactive and visually engaging using tools like Power BI, Excel, and Tableau.Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work on a wide range of projects, simplifying complex datasets and providing businesses with actionable insights that guide smarter decisions.  
   For me, data isnâ€™t just about numbers itâ€™s about finding the hidden patterns, trends and narratives that can make a real impact. I go beyond just analyzing numbers my focus is on crafting compelling narratives from data, uncovering trends, optimizing processes and presenting findings in an easily digestible way. If youâ€™re in need of someone who can not only analyze but also visually present data in an engaging manner, youâ€™ve come to the right place. Iâ€™m eager to collaborate with you to turn data into meaningful and actionable insights.
